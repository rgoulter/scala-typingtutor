* If 'typing' a large file, could make a practice session be only small
  part of this. -- So, 'save' and 'restore' progress practising through

* Pay off technical debt; current implementation is a sketch, not a well
  architectured system.
* Save the 'results' from the session.
* Fancy analysis of results, like common typos (esp. the k-gram leading to it),
  speed between keys, and fancy things like that.
